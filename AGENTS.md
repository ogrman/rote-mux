Always run tests using `cargo test` in the project root after making changes. Fix any failing tests.

Always run `cargo fmt` after all tests pass.

TODO.md may contain a list of things to fix.

Whenever the config format changes, example.yaml and README.md should be updated as well.

Any scripts that are used in integration tests should have a name that starts with the test name.
